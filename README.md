## General info
When we login and view 'My Courses' section on Online Learning Portals like Udemy , iterating through courses becomes tiresome.'
So , to directly go to the desired course page , we have scraped the names + links of the courses.

Current 'My Course ' page on Udemy shows 4 paginations on single page , so the script scraped upto 4 pages by clicking on the next button.
Alternate method is to use URL links.
